# MPI_Algorithms
Implementations of the sorting algorithms presented in my MPI Paper  
To replicate the tests done, you must check ***testing.py***, which can be modified.  
In ***testing.py*** you can add array sizes to test in the ***sizes list***.  
In ***testing.py*** you can add the interval end part (e.g [0,your_number]) in the ***ranges list***  
You can also choose which algorithms you want your tests to run on by calling the following *Functions:* ***bubble, insertion, selection, merge_, quick_, counting_, radix_***
